# What is this?
Some simple code that recognizes and quantifies rhymes, slant rhymes and varying degrees of alliteration by 
using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (part of the nltk libraries) to convert words to their phonetic components (phones) as
represented by the ARPAbet symbols found here: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict 
and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET

Information about different types of rhymes can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_and_imperfect_rhymes 
and here: https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/slant-rhyme

# Why?
To learn about the characteristics of rhymes, and the media which employs them. Potential applications include analysing and generating rhyme schemes automatically, visulization of song structure and phonetic sounds (i.e. simulating synesthesia), measuring the rhyme and alliteration density of a given lyric or poem, and looking at the particular rhyming style of an artist.
